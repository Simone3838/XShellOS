Most of the code here isn't actually mine! Here is a list of the places I took this code from:

* PNG implementation originally by @qookei on GitHub (https://gist.github.com/qookei/3e0b068ee8c6926da3016d12f95a4578)
  -- In the public domain according to the author

* Tinfl.c: Taken from https://code.google.com/archive/p/miniz/
  -- In the public domain (Unlicense). See bottom of "tinfl.c" for more information.
